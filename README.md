This work is one of my personal project on portfolio optimization using QAOA.

The Yahoo Finance Dataset contains historical and real-time data for stocks, currencies, etc. I have chosen the top 5 tech stocks from Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Nvidia. 
My hybrid quantum-classical model is going to predict in what asset an investor should invest given a budget constraint (to invest exactly in 3 out of the 5 assets) implemented here as penalty. 
Parameters such as risk aversion factor and the penalty score are chosen arbitrarily.
